Stock Trading: Quanta Mini Strategy Analysis Project
The Quanta Mini Strategy Analysis Project is a stock trading analysis tool that helps identify breakout opportunities based on stock price and volume data. The project demonstrates your ability to set up a full-stack application that fetches stock data, analyzes the data to detect breakouts, and allows users to download a report based on their input criteria.

Fetch and process financial data using external APIs
Implement a basic strategy analysis for stock trading
Handle data integrity and prevent lookahead bias
Provide a user-friendly experience with front-end and back-end integration
